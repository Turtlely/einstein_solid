# einstein_solid
 
Program for calculating the entropy and number of microstates of Einstein solids.

I don't recommend using this program with more than 2 Einstein solids or thousands+ energy units and oscillators; the numbers get too large.

## Entropy as a function of the energy in a single Einstein solid in a system of two weakly interacting Einstein solids: (N_solids=2, N_oscillators = 300, q_total=300)

## Multiplicity as a function of the energy in a single Einstein solid in a system of two weakly interacting Einstein solids: (N_solids=2, N_oscillators = 300, q_total=300)
